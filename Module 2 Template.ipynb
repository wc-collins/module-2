    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevalence & incidence\n",
    "- The prevalence of pulmonary fibrotic disease is approximately 13 to 20 per 100,000 people worldwide, and global incidence is approximately 5.8 new cases per 100,000 people per year.\n",

    "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40775309/\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle)\n",
    "- Some risk factors for pulmonary fibrosis include previous autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, some viral infections that can cause abnormal lung scarring, exposure to hazardous materials like asbestos, coal, and mold, as well as radiation treatments and regular smoking. Additionally, genetics sometimes plays a role, as there are certain genes that can increase disease risk.\n",

    "\n",
    "Symptoms\n",
    "- Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis are shortness of breath, dry and persistent cough, excessive fatigue, unintended weight loss, aching muscles and joints, and occasionally \"clubbing\" of fingertips.\n",

    "## Data-Set: \n",
    "Unpublished data was collected by the Peirce-Cottler Lab (Dept. of Biomedical Engineering) and Kim Lab (Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of recently generated experimental measurements that examine pulmonary function and structure at both the cellular and tissue levels. These data were obtained to increase understanding of how inflammatory processes contribute to lung disease/injury under different physiological conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection & Techniques:\n",
    "- Data were collected using imaging techniques.\n",
    "    - Lung tissues were analyzed through immunohistochemistry and immunofluoresence to help identify protein makrers and cell types. \n",
    "    - Vessel diamter, cell density, and intensity of fluoresence were measured from confocal microscopy images with the utlization of ImageJ. These quantitative measurements were expressed in micrometers, cells per area, and arbitrary fluorescence units, respectively.\n",
    "    - Black and white images of lung tissue were provided in the dataset. White pixels represent markings of fibrosis whereas black pixels represent healthy lung tissue.\n",
    "- Molecular assays were also used (when applicable) to assess gene and protein expression levels, and were reported as fold-change or pg/mL."
